# VIT-PARKING-SYSTEM
This project is a real time IOT solution to the growing problem of parking in Metropolitan cities as well as places with Huge rush.

In this project we have implemented a simple model in which we have shown the application of IOT as how it can be used to provide a solution for the problem. The scenario has been chosen for my College (VIT) parking lot.

Sensors are placed in the parking lot which detect and send processed data to cloud.

Data from cloud is then processed and brought into an APPLICATION built for the project. The mobile Android Application can be used by the customers through which they can easily see which parking lots are free at a given time at the parking lot.
